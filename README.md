# HollowNote
It is a web application that is used for taking notes.
The application uses image as a canvas, where user can select any section (pix coordinates) of the image to create note from the menu.
E.g. From an image of universe a single galaxy can be selected where name can be given and note can be written, stored and accessed.

The concept for this application derived from stars of the night sky, as I wanted to give stars meaning of my own. I mainly use this as a base for projects before
I start one, where I name a star by the project name and store notes in it.

# What is used:
-HTML<br />
-CSS<br />
-javascript<br />
-jquery<br />
-php<br />
-apache web server

# Extras:
-It does not have to be star image it can be anything. (change image in <img>);<br />
-Image section can be change though css .setBox<br />
-New features can also be added to improve, i.e. to search stars or the high way inspect source.<br />
-Stars can also be create onclick using CSS assigned to div.<br />
-All notes are stored in text file in Stella folder. (can be changed)<br />
-For test create new or find 265_59_HollowNote from image (play around).<br />

# Instruction: it is easy to use but >>
-Double click any point of the image to create a section.<br />
-The use the menu on the left to create. Rest of the button are self explanatory.
